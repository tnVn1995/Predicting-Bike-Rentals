## [Here's the notebook](https://github.com/tung2921/Predicting-Bike-Rentals/blob/master/Predicting_Bike_Rentals.ipynb)
In this notebook, I'll be building a random forest machine learning model to predict the total rental bikes in Washington, D.C. The dataset I'll be working with is compiled by Hadi Fanaee-T at the University of Porto. You can download the dataset from [University of California, Irvine's website](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset). The file contains 17380 rows, with each row representing the number of bike rentals for a single hour of a single day.
